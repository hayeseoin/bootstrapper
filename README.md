# Bootstrapping - Meta Repo

Public meta repo for bootstrapping configs. This repo is public, and the scripts hosted in it are public. Not all of the source repos it pulls from are public. 

## [Linux Dotfiles and Toolkit](/scripts-and-config/)

Deploys my preferred dotfiles config, a new command prompt, and a number of personal tools

Deploy command: 
```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hayeseoin/bootstrapper-wip/refs/heads/main/scripts-and-config/main.sh | bash
```
